# Purpose of the app
This app was created to experiment with making a background that has star parallax effect to be used later in another website.

# Documentation of how this project was created
App created with the command `express star-parallax -e` where -e stands for ejs support.

## Adding SASS support
run
`$ npm i sass`
`$ npm i nodemon --save-dev`

Add these to scrips inside package.json
```
"dev": "nodemon ./bin/www & npm run scss",
"scss": "sass --watch src/scss/main.scss public/stylesheets/main.css"
```

create the file `/src/scss/main.scss`.

be sure that in your view the stylesheet corresponds to the one that your sass creates

run server with `npm run dev`.

The public/stylesheets file is ignored because the stylesheets files are anyway generated by sass.
